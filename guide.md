### Story Quest

* [Tartaglia: Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mighty_Cyclops%27_Adventure!)
  * **Summary**: The Traveler and Paimon investigate a Ruin Guard disturbance near Lingju Pass and encounter Teucer, a young boy from Snezhnaya searching for his brother, a 'toy seller' in Liyue. They discover that Teucer's brother is Childe, who maintains a facade to hide his identity as a Fatui Harbinger. Childe asks the Traveler and Paimon to accompany Teucer around Liyue while he attends to business. During their tour, Teucer insists on visiting his brother, leading them to witness Childe's dealings with Treasure Hoarders and Fatui recruits. To preserve his cover, Childe improvises explanations for his actions. Later, Teucer requests to see the 'Institute for Toy Research,' which is actually an abandoned Ruin Guard facility. Childe leads them there and, to protect Teucer, uses his Foul Legacy Transformation to destroy the Ruin Guards, injuring himself in the process. Before Teucer departs for Snezhnaya, Childe secretly gives him a Mr. Cyclops action figure. Teucer thanks the Traveler and Paimon for the adventure, and Childe expresses gratitude for their help in maintaining his cover.
  * **Characters**: Childe, Teucer
  * **Important Lore**:
    * Teucer is Childe's youngest sibling and is unaware of his brother's true occupation.
    * Childe utilizes his Foul Legacy Transformation to combat Ruin Guards, injuring himself in the process as he hadn't fully recovered from using it last at the Golden House.

Alongside them are Wanyan, an ardent follower of Havria, and Kliment, a Fatui archaeologist with ulterior motives. Upon discovering the ruins, Zhongli proposes a contract: each person may claim one relic in turn. However, Kliment breaks the agreement out of greed and is swiftly expelled by Zhongli. Wanyan, seeking to vindicate Havria and condemn Morax, also violates the contract. She learns a harsh truth: Havria was betrayed and slain by her own people during the Archon War. Disillusioned, Wanyan departs in silence. The quest concludes with Zhongli reflecting on history's fragility and entrusting the Traveler with preserving Liyue's legacy.
  * **Characters**: Zhongli, Havria

    * Zhongli tells the traveler he wanted them to join him to carry on the memory of Havria should the Traveler move on and Teyvat be destroyed.
      > History records, but history may be changed. This incident proved that. Time is a mighty force, and histories twist in its flow...
      >
      > I need to find a better way of recording history in order to engrave its truth.
      >
      > Stone carvings were one such ancient method. But unchanging stone, immovable earth, even one such as myself... Someday, we may all disappear. Therefore, I thought of you, Traveler.
      >
      > You are one who crosses the celestial atlas, and who passes through countless worlds. If our history is engraved in your memory, it will one day accompany you into another world.
      >
      > As long as a Traveler like you is able to record what happened, then a backup of sorts will exist for times and tides of Teyvat.

    >
    > But what was that sediment I saw forming at the bottom of the vial? It should not have been there... What could it mean?
    >
    > Those born of earth are bound by its imperfections, but those born of chalk are free of impurities... You and I are alike, both composed of a substance that has yet to be fully defined...

### World Quest

* Dragonspire
  * **Note**: Dragonspire's story telling is very different from later world quests and relies heavily on the FromSoftware. Below is a brief summary of the lore learned through various sources in version 1.2
  * **Lore**:
    * In ancient times, the civilazation of Sal Vindagnyr existed on the mountain. Their civilization centered around a large white tree which was of great importance to their culture. For unknown reasons, a nail split off from Celestia and landed near the summit. The city became shrouded in cloud and mist, drawn about by snowstorms. A hero from another land who resided in Sal Vindagnyr left to find answers. Meanwhile, their sacred tree began to wither away. Attempts to heal it all proved fruitless. As the end of their civilazation drew near, a scribe cursed the heavens for forsaking them, wishing for a nation with no god to one day emerge. An unknown time later, the hero returned only to find that everyone had already perished.
    * During the catacalysm, the corrupted dragon Durin descended upon Dragonspire. Before he could reach Mondstadt, he was slain by Dvalin. The blood from Durin's remains began to seep into the region, eventually reaching the roots of the sacred tree.
      * Vol. 1 of [*Breeze Amidst the Forest*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Breeze_Amidst_the_Forest) claims Durin was a creation of the alchemist Rhinedottir (aka Gold)

The Fatui, learning of the sword's power, attempt to seize it, but are thwarted by the Traveler and Albedo. Through a series of trials, the sword is purified, and its power is stabilized. The event concludes with Albedo expressing gratitude and once again musing to himself:
    > This dragon's life force resonates with me...
    >
    > Not because it's a dragon, but because I am... me.
    >
    > Rhinedottir... Master... Is this your creation, the giant dragon Durin?
    >
    > Was the two of us meeting really a good thing?
  * **Characters**: Albedo, Sucrose
  * **Important Lore**:
    * Festering Desire is a sword imbued with remnants of Durin's power.

Suspicious of his authenticity, they investigate further and discover that Starsnatcher is a fraud exploiting people's fears. With Xiao's guidance, they perform a ritual to confront Starsnatcher's spirit while he is asleep. After making an example out of him, Starsnatcher apologizes and decides to go on a pilgramige of self reflection on his own accord.
    > Pervases: I sense his aura upon you... that, and the heavy burden of his karma.
    >
    > *sigh* Even after all these millennia, he still must endure such tremendous suffering? ...I am truly ashamed.
    >
    > Life is a precious thing, yes... But when I think of the burden that the Conqueror of Demons must bear... *sigh* death seems to me to have been the easy way out. A selfish indulgence, even.
    >
    > Birthdays are joyful occasions, but by the same token, it is hard to not be melancholy on the anniversary of one's death.
  * **Characters**: Xiao, Pervases, Starsnatcher

The quest concludes with Hu Tao expressing her appreciation for the Traveler's assistance and offering a deeper understanding of her role in guiding spirits.
    > As I explained, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was, once upon a time, more akin to a doctor's office than an actual funeral parlor.
    >
    > During the Archon War, piles of corpses covered the wilderness. People were plunged into misery and suffering. Disease was spreading all over the land. Death devastated the world of the living.
    >
    > Such were the times when the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was first established. As humans, its founders were deemed too insignificant to matter, but slowly, they managed to drive away death.
    >
    > After generations, Liyue Harbor became a bustling hub of prosperity, luring people with dreams of great fame and abundant Mora. But in the end, some lunatics stirred up the "legacy" of the dead.
    >
    > By that, I mean the remnants of the defeated gods that ravaged the world. I won't go into specifics of that situation, but suffice to say that at its peak, life was on the verge of bringing about its own extinction, while death was coming back with a vengeance.
    >
    > It took a long, long time, longer than you'd think, to restore balance and reinstate the "border." Without it, Liyue Harbor as we know it wouldn't be here today — neither would the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, you, or me.
    >
    > What you make of my words is up to you. I do hope that most of it flew over your heads, though. The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is just that, a funeral parlor. Nothing more to it.
    >
    > We live in peaceful times, but this harmonious coexistence between life and death should never be taken for granted.
