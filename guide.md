Childe asks the Traveler and Paimon to accompany Teucer around Liyue while he attends to business. During their tour, Teucer insists on visiting his brother, leading them to witness Childe's dealings with Treasure Hoarders and Fatui recruits. To preserve his cover, Childe improvises explanations for his actions. Later, Teucer requests to see the 'Institute for Toy Research,' which is actually an abandoned Ruin Guard facility. Childe leads them there and, to protect Teucer, uses his Foul Legacy Transformation to destroy the Ruin Guards, injuring himself in the process.
